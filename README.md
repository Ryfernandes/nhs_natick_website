Current code for Natick High School National Honor Society website (work in progress)

This website is meant to have members of the National Honor Society in Natick sign in with their Google accounts, and then be able to see any relevant data that is associated with them regarding how many hours of community service they have logged, their attendance, etc. So far, I have implemented a login page with a Sign In With Google button using Bootstrap and Google Documentation. Additionally, I have created a brief dashboard page on my website (file not in repo) that simply displays the email passed to it in session storage by the login page. This is just for testing however, so I have yet to include it in this repo.

I am currently running my website with a web hosting plan from GoDaddy, and am uploading my files to the cPanel file manager after creating/testing them with the WebStorm IDE and localhost. I have begun researching the second part of my project, which would be to use the Google Sheets API, however to do this securely, I would need a server, so I am going to have to reconfigure my setup on GoDaddy in the near future.
